What did I learn? Well I learned a lot. I am submitting this V0 assignment of a calculator app, and I was surprised how well it worked. In the past, getting the frontend and backend to work well with AI was difficult, but V0 set up this calculator app with ease. I am still experimenting with more difficult prompts, however the results of such an early stage development is very suprising. I plan on submitting another pull request with more detailed learnings here soon.
